# machinelearning-train
This repository contains the code required to create the ML pipeline used to train a sample model.

The code in this repository should run whenver the pipeline itself is updated to recreate the Pipeline.

In this example, when the learning data has been updated, the pipeline itself will not need to be modified unless the location or structure have been changed.
